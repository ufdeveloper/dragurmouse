dragurmouse
===========

simple web app which records mouse clicks, publishes to facebook.

The app uses facebook feed dialog to post to the users timeline.

THINGS TO BE WORKED ON
-removing the FB dialogue, and instead using post through graph api(, but this required curl support).
-after user clicks share on facebook, a lot of things happen in the background. need to change this behavior.
